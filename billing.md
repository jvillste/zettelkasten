# How to bill an online tool?

## Requirements

* Users should be able to evaluate the service before paying anything
* Micro payments are not cheap with all payment providers

## Solution

* 0.10€ fee for every 24 hours during which the service is used. Each 24 hour period begins when the service is used and the previous period has ended.
* Billed for every 3€
* Payment method such as PayPal account is required only when there is a bill that must be payed.

### Pros

* Users pay only for actual usage.
* Users get 30 days of usage before they need to provide a payment method.
* Payments are combined to alleviate payment provider fees.
* Billing period is not based on local but global time so time zones and day light saving time do not need to be taken into account.

## Cons

* If the tool usage time does not directly correlate to the benefit that it gives tot he user it adds pressure to the user to use the tool quicly.
  * Billing that is based on the results that the user acchieves with the tool would be better
