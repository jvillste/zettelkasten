# Chat as threads

* A conversation forms always threads like in Flowdock
* A channel is just a tag that can be applied to a thread
* Threads have a URL
* A thread can start as a 1-to-1 conversation and then later on can be tagged so that it shows in public channels.
* Search can be optionally narrowed down by channel tags
* 1-to-1 conversation is just threads tagged by the users that are involved. Users can be added to the conversation by adding them as tags to the tread. Group conversations are formed this way.
* Messages can be made private by encrypting them with the recipients public key. These remain private even if more tags are added to the thread.
* A thread is also like a tag that is applied to messages. Messages can be moved between threads by changing thread tags.
* A thread can be tagged by other threads which are then considered to be parent threads.
