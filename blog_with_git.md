# Blogging with git

* Posts are markdown files in a git repository
* Each post has metadata that is expressed as one edn map at the begining of each post file
* A web application exposes the posts as html from a local git repository
  * Posts are read to a datomic database each time the git repo is updated
* Posts publishing date is given in it's metadata.
  * Posts without publishing date are considered drafts.
* RSS feed that lists published posts in the publishing date order
  * Posts can be edited after publishing but this does not affect their publish date
* Authoring can be done in the github web user interface
  * A command in the web application to pull from github
* A version history view with diffing functionality
  * Implemented by parsing the log and diff output from git
* Each post has an id generated by (format "%x" (- (System/currentTimeMillis) 1446790411973))
  * This is used in RSS guid -field and post urls
  * The web application shows a new id when it's called with the url "/new-post-id".This id can then be copied to a new post file.
