Thinking seems to be like finding paths in a mesh comprised of words. We can not think about concepts for which we do not have words. Also the connections between words must be discovered before we can use them when finding paths.

It may be that abstract thinking evolved from space navigation. We use so called grid cells for space navigation. See [How Grid Cells Map Space](https://numenta.com/blog/2018/05/25/how-grid-cells-map-space/)

We should find a systematic way of adding new words and connections to our vocabulary.

Some languages have single word for a concept for which multiple words are used in another language.
