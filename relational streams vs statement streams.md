Dabric stream may describe changes to multiple indexes as in relational databases. It may also describe changes to a single "statement index" that has the columns entity, attribute and value.

In a relational database each row in a relation describes the state of one entity. Each entity may be given a [Surrogate key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key) from an id sequence but the relation may also use [Natural key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key) i.e. some set of columns in the relation identify the entity uniquelly.

Statement index always uses artificial surrogate keys that are globaly unique.
