Subscribing to posts is like grawing RSS feeds.

Reactions to posts must be pushed to the post publishers and their followers.

## How can [[Dali#origin|origins]] refereing to other origins be discrovered by clients?

"back links" could be added to origins that are refered to from other origins

A reaction ( comment or like etc. ) to a post in another origin would be stored to the origin of the reacting user and only a back link would be stored to the origin in which the original post is stored. Client that reads the post follows the back link to fetch the reaction.

No content needs to be copied from origin to origin and thus can be retracted. Cacheing may still occur and in general there is no quarantee that a copy is not made.
