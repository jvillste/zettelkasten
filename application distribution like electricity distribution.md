Distributing computer programs and code libraries should be handled with a generic p2p file sharing network instead of programming language or operating system specific content distribution networks.

A coffee brewer can use the same wire as the micro wave to get its power. So could python and ruby use the same file distribution system to get their libraries.

Starting a computer program on any machine should only require giving a name and optionally a version number. The system should then download the required binaries, compile them to the right machine architecture and run in a secure sandbox. Just like web browsers now do for javascript and web assembly.
