There is no truth - only debate

## The problem

Critical thinking and argumentation is hard. We should develop tools that allow people to collaborate in argument analysis over the internet.

## How to get rid of invalid arguments?

Each user has a status:

* A newbie
* An arguer
* A moderator

The arguments of a newbie are not visible without a moderator acceptance. A user can be promoted to an arguer when he has entered enough moderator accepted arguments. An arguer can be promoted to a moderator.

The moderators must have efficient tools to moderate large amounts of arguments. It should be easy to mark argument as invalid in such a way that the arguer can understand and fix the error.

## Design decisions

* Arguments should be presented without the name of the arguer so that they are not accepted or rejected based on it.
