# Common visual language for structured data
Icons in computer user interfaces usually represent nouns or actions. Could we develop graphical user interface elements that represent some other concepts in the field of knowledge management?

A table can be thought of listing certain attributes of entities. One entity is described by one row. An outline can represent attributes of one entity. Each node in the outline describes one attribute. An attribute value can be on or many literals or one or many entities. Those other entities can them selves be represented as an outline or a table.

An entity in the user interface could be represented in some universal icon, or the icon could vary based on which kind of entity it is.

# Using trees to visualize adjacent notes
Spring based local graph is not optimal because:
- cycles in the graph are possibly not too useful, what matters is what notes are related to the current note
- note labels easily overlap each other

One tree for back links and one for forward links.

Adjustable depth

Links could be grouped by their labels / types.

# Editing structured documents the paredit way

Wysiwyg rich text editors are good because they don't let the user break the structure of the document. They are bad because the structure is not always visible to the user so he often can't understand why the document behaves as it does.

Markdown is good becuse it exposes the structure to the user. It's bad because it let's the user ebreak the structure in a way that a markdown parser can not parse it or parses it in a way different than what the user meant.

Paredit let's the user see the structure and prevents him from breaking it. Could there be paredit kind of tool for structured text documents?

# Funding Argupedia by providing hosting service for it
Mastodon let's people run their own servers in their paid hosting service. This way the data and software keeps open. Another example is Minehut that hosts Minecraft servers.

The datastructure of argupedia and software that reads and writes it must be free. Also people should be free to store their data anywhere they want, not only one SAAS providers machines. This paid hosting service would thus not be the only way to run argupedia.

Downside of this is that taking care of infrastructure is not something I like to do.

# Moderating argupedia
Argupedia may have to be moderated like an open source software project through pull requests.

It would then be crucial to give merge rights to objective people.

# Serialization format for arguments
One example of argumentation serialization format is [Argdown](https://argdown.org/).

Argupedia would need to make references between different files possible so that the files form a distributed graph of arguments.
