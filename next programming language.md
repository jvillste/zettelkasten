goals:
- based on functional datastructures and interfaces that those implement, maybe transducers?
- extensive and coherent set of core functions laveraging long traditions of functional programming in common lisp and clojure and haskell etc.
- clear english symbol names so that code is easy to read even if the language is unfamiliar
- clojure like homoiconic syntax
- compiles to wasm
- interop with c or rust libraries

There could be a version of the same language but with static typing and borrow checking for systems programming purposes. See [carp-lang/Carp: A statically typed lisp, without a GC, for real-time applications.](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp)
