# dabric streams for collaborative cad
It is essential to be able to collaboratively edit a big cad model or a game world. With Dabric streams this could be done like with git branches. There would be one master stream and each collaborator would have "feature streams" for their changes. The collaborators could read each others streams in realtime to notice conflicts before trying to apply their streams on the master stream.

Autodesk Fusion 360 had branchches for a while: [Creating and Merging Branches? What happened? : Fusion360](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fusion360/comments/ewg1sq/creating_and_merging_branches_what_happened/)

Unreal engine 5 splits game worlds into small files to enable collaborative editing even if only one designer can check out each file at a time to make changes: [One File Per Actor | Unreal Engine Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/WorldFeatures/OneFilePerActor/)
