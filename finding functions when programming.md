# finding functions when programming
The IDE should allow searching for functions in libraries that are not yet downloaded. The public functions in libraries should be typed so that the IDE could find other functions from other libraries that operate on those types.

Loading new libraries should not require process restart.

If you wanted to encode a number in base64 you would search and select a function that does it and the IDE would download the library and load it in into the running process. You should be able to see the documentation of the functions in the IDE before selecting which one you would like to use.
