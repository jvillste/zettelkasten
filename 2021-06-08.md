- type branding

[Nominal Typing - TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/nominaltyping)

Enums

```
enum FooIdBrand { \_ \= "" };
type FooId \= FooIdBrand & string;
```

Interfaces


```
interface FooId extends String x{
  \_fooIdBrand: string; // To prevent type errors
}
```
