# The problem
Structured text can now be written as plain text, XML or by WYSIWYG editors. Plain text format such as Markdown are good because of their simplicity. Any plain text editor can be used to edit such documents. Plain text is also easy to diff visually.

# Text document as Dabric stream
Structured text could be expressed as a hierarchy of entities in Dabric stream. [[entity hierarchy]] could be used to keep entities related to single text document close to each other in the EAV index.
