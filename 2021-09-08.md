# struct vs record
Struct has the schema out of band. Record value is a sequence of attribute values.

Record is a sequence of attribute -id, value type, value triples.

# attribute typing
Atributes are not associated with a value type. They are only semantic identities. Value type is fixed only in a file. If the attribute values are integers and the file contains only one byte integers for that attribute, a struct that reserves only one byte for it can be used. In another file the attribute may have larger values and more bytes would then have to be allocated.

Attributes could be associated with a function that validates the attribute values.

Struct and record type definitions in a file header must always thus include value type defiitions for each attribute.
