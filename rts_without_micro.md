# RTS without micro

* Master of orion with StarCraft real time aspects
* Map is a graph like in master of orion, galcon or ai war
* Units are commanded in groups
  * No unit micro management
* The goal is to provide the core aspects of StarCraft fast paced economy management without the high clicks per minute rates and with a user interface that supports decision making by hiding details when appropriate
* Each units strengths and weaknesses against enemy units must be visualized so that there is no need to learn them by heart
* Each node has a resorce count and list of buildings
* Tech tree is develped by constructing buildings like in StarCraft
