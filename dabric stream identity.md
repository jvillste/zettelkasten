A dabric stream must have a globaly unique identifiers so that the entities described in the stream can have compressable and still globally unique identifiers.

A domain / path -pair could be used as a human friendly identifier. For example the dabric prelude could be identified as dabric.net/prelude.

When a stream does not have to be identified by humans, a UUID could be used. For example a stream that describes a word processor document could use a UUID as an identifier.

It's worth noting that a stream identifier does not guarantee authenticity of the data in the stream. See [[dabric stream authentication]]
