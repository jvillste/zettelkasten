Often we have to open an ssh connection and a shell to a remote machine to inspect it's files. When combining [[low level cloud infrastructure]] and [[repl as shell]] this could be achieved by lanching some programming language repl on a machine that has access to the files. One could then load to the repl the needed functions equivalent to the unix programs `file`, `hexdump` or `head`. The functions could open graphical user interfaces using [[universal sandbox]] that allows using the local GPU to draw on the users screen. We would then not have to pedendent on the programs that are installed on a remote machine and the text user interface provided by shells.

Bash is a programming language and repl. It's usefullness is based on the installed programs on the machine. Many of them are covered by the POSIX standard and are thus widely available, but it would be much more versatile to be able to load any functions from the internet to be used in just the current repl session.
