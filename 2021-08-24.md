# Type layers
Example:
- length prefixed byte array
- language primitive: UTF-8 string
- attribute: First name
- entity: First name in a person struct

Example:
- byte array: one byte byte array
- language primitive: unsigned 8 bit integer
- struct or a library primitive: unsigned 8 bit integer as day of month
- attribute: day of month in a persons birthday
- entity: day of month in the birthday of a person called "Jack"

Example:
- byte array: length prefixed byte array
- library primitive: JPEG image
- attribute: picture of a person
- entity: picture of a person called "Jack"

Programming languages differ in what primiteive types they offer. C -does not offer UTF-8 strings and byte arrays are used instead. C also does not offer arbitrary big integers like Clojure does. Dabric value types should provide all the needed information to interpret a given value as a primitive in any programming language. The most primitive fallback type is a byte array. Thus it is enough to know the size of the value in bytes.

# bootstrapping dabric value types
If value types are documented as entities we first need value types that is used to describe them.

- primitive type: unsigned 8 bit integer
- semantic single primitive value type: stream id index reference as 8 bit unsigned integer, UTF-8 string as variable length byte array
- struct type: first name as UTF-8 string, shoe size as 8 bit unsigned integer
