There could be generic graph editor that resembles a plain text editor like Emacs. Buffers in a graph editor would correspond to root views that are lists of views that comprise of outline and table views.

Outline view displays properties of one entity one below another. Table view displays properties of multiple entities.

The editor would have tabs that display root views and tabs could lay on top of each other or side by side.

Root views would be stored in a datbric stream just like the data that they display.

Root views could contain also headings and paragraphs in addition to outline or table views.
