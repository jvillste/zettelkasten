# how to keep track where each streams latest state can be retrieved?

Stream could be identified with a domain and DNS is used to map stream ids to ip addresses.

Stream could be identified with a keypair and the private key could be used to sign a record that describes where the stream can be found. A DNS like registry should be set up to keep track of these signed records. Could such a registry work in a P2P way without dns like hierarchy?

# how a stream can publish data about other streams entity?

Activitypub has some mechanism to publish comments about entry in another system.
