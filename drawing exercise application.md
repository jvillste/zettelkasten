* It shows an image and a drawing area. The user must copy the image to the drawing area.
* The application calculates how different the original image is to the drawed image.
	* Value and color differences are calculated separaterly
* Two or more reference points can be marked to the image and they are shown in the drawing area
* Differences can be shown visually
* Brush strokes can be recorded and published to a site
* Users can submit their own images and their own brush stroke logs and compete who paints the image most accurately and in the shortest time
* The application can generate increasingly complex images
	* The user must copy the images with certain time limits and accuracy to get the next image.
	* There is an online hall of fame list for such generated images and their accepted brush stroke logs
	* The images can be generated from a pseudo random generator so that they are identical for each user
* The application can render a 3d model in various angles
	* By drawing the same model in different angels the user can learn it's shape
	* A human body model with bending joints could also be implemeted to learn human anatomy
	* 3d scanned real human models may be of better use for anatomy study
	* A "toon" shader could be used to simplify the rendering so that it would be reasonably fast to copy the images
	* A global illumination model could be used for rendering to study light behavior
