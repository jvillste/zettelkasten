# using WASM for defining value serialization formats
A Dali origin can contain WASM code for interpreting values. For example different image format deserializers could be loaded that way. The Dali client knows how to represent RGB values as images, but for decoding jpegs or giffs to RGB -values it would have to load the wasm code that does it.
# serializing values
Conceptual model for data must be separated from implementations. Concaptual model aims for simplicity and extensibility. Implementations aim for efficiency, portability and practicality.

How to make the format extensible?
- datatypes should be described with statements: multilingual textual descriptions for humands and WASM for computers.
- primitive data types are fixed
  - positive integer
  - boolean
  - string

Could all other value types be composed of positive integers?

Why would an integer be a primitive type while date or image would not be?

ASN.1 DER -format uses type-length-value encoding.

Wikipedia only summarizes and refers to research that originates from somewhere else.

What if there was similar wiki for original collaborative research? It would be like a shared zettelkasten.
