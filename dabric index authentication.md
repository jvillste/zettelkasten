Dabric indexes are immutable b-trees. The b-ree nodes refer to other nodes by hash values of the contents of the nodes. Thus each index state can be identified by the hash value of it's root node.

To ensure the authenticity of the data in the index, the reader must obtain the hash value of the index root from a trusted source just like when authenticating the dabric streams. See [[dabric stream authentication]]
