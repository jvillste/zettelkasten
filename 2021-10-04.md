What is the byte size of a tupple type instance in a file header?

A tupple of two two byte integers is always four bytes. The size given in the header may contradict this. Still specifying the size always in the type instance definition is valuable since that way the reader can read the values as byte arrays even if the type is unknown.

Programs reading a dabric file should only need to implement the types that they are interested in and still be able to read the whole file.

JSON restricts to using only dictionaries, arrays, strings and numbers. This is enough for conveying any information, but does not provide much space efficiency. Generic text compression mitigates this quite well.
