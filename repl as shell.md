# repl as shell
Sometimes it's usefull to interact with a proces in a specific network. This can be done by running a virtual machine and a shell in it. A virutal machine with all it's posix applications is overly complicated process. Similar interactions could be done for example with a clojure repl in a JVM. Running any language runtime should be possible just like running virtual machines. Both are processes, one is just alot more compilicated process.
