# How to internationalize attributes?
Wikidata has string values that include language code. If such internationalized string values would be sorted by language code it would be efficient to find string with the given language code from an index.

Attributes could also be internationalized by combaining the attribute entity id with a language code. for example: [1 2 "en"] If entity id is a sequence, the last value in the sequence would be the language code.

# ident
Idents are human readable unique names for entities such as attributes. Idents were introduced by Datomic.

Stream idents are human readable names for streams. Stream idents are local to the stream. They are like namespace declarations in xml documents.

Idents can be internationalized. The same entity may have multiple idents for many languages.
