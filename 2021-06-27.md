# transaction log format

- large blobs are not stored in the log, only their hashes
- origin ids are assigned small surrogate integers. These assignments are logged as statements in the transaction log.
- origin surrogate 0 refers to dali prelude that describes all built in attributes

# identifying origins

If origins are identifyied with domain names, ssl sertificates can be used to verify the authenticity of data segments.

If originsa re identified by uuid:s they are not dependent on the ownership of domain names.

Thre transaction log could specify what domain should be trusted to sign the transactions. This ownership could then be transfered to other domain without chaning the identity of the origin.

# build in attributes

- 0 programmatic name.
- 1 origin surrogate. A number used to refer to origins in the transaction log.
- 2 origin id. A uuid identifying an origin.
