# GPU shader image processing pipeline
It would be useful to have a code library that can apply image filters that are expressed as GPU shaders.

In a lightroom like photo archive application the shaders that are applied to images could be stored in the sidecart -files so that they could be applied even if the original photo archive application is no longer available.

There could be an online repository of shaders and they could be applied interactively to images in a photo archive application.
