Computing hardware consists of:
- disks
- cpu:s
- ram
- network interfaces

How should we express how software is run on hardware?

Software is stateful. Operations on the state are:
- start / stop process
- mount / unmount disk
- attach / unattach network interface
- add / remove available cpu core
