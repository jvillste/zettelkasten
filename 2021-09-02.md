# unified dependency management
What if all programing languages would be implemented so that they run in a wasm sandbox and use content based addressing for dependency management.

Instead of requiring a specific python version to be installed to the machines global path, a python script would require a specific wasm binary addressed by it's hash.

All software in the machine could be stored in a single content addressed blob storage.  Content based addressing would be used to refer to applications and their dependencies.
