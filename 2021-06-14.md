# why data is serialized?
- storing on disk
- transfering trhrough networks

# what are value types?
Value types are sets of symbols that have specific meaning for humans and for which there exists computer programs that can manipulate them. To apply the computer programs, serialized values must be converted to values understood by the programming language.

Record types are domain specific types composed of value types. Value types are not specific to any domain.

Serialization value type can differ from programming language value type. An integer can store a floating point value if the decimals are zero.

Computer programs should be able to convey values that can not be converted to the value types that the programming language understands.

Values of a value type are ordered.

Value types are not collection types.

# prefix property
A code system has prefix property if none of it's codes are prefixes of other codes in the system. All fixed length code systems have prefix proeprty, but some variable length code sytems do not.

Huffman codes have the prefix property.
