In [Iterative Drawing - The Fastest Way to Improve - YouTube](https://youtu.be/k0ufz75UvHs) Sycra Yasin explains why the most efective way to learn drawing is to draw something in few seconds, analyze it and then draw the same thing a bit differenlty. This way the analythical part of the brain gets trained in analyzing and intuitive part of the brain get's lots of excercise from the big amount of drawings.

A drawing excercise application could allow drawing variatons of some part of the drawing quickly. The drawings could form a tree in which each branch iterates some part of it's parent.
