A [[file management system]] could be used to synchronize files between devices regardles of the folder structure in which they are stored on the disks. One could for example instruct the system to copy all photos from a phone to a laptop when ever they are connected to the same network at the same time. The user could then look at photos on the laptop based on their creation date without opening a specific folder to see the files.

Photos have rich metadata by which they can be filtered. Thumbnails could be included in the metadata indexes so that the user could search photos in the file agent network without transfering large image files between computers.

If needed, a folder structure could be synthesized by photo metadata and files could be hard linked there. The photos could thus be stored in various different folder structures but still be written only in one place on the disk. There could be folders based on tags and folders based on creation date.

A folder structure is kind of a metadata for the files. Same files could be stored in different folder structures on different machines and the user could still keep the files in sync in all of the structures.
